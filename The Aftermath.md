"When do you think we can leave?" Reeta asked her parents gently, squeezing her baba's hand firmly.

"I don't know. I thought they'd be gone by now, but we're running out of food. We may have to leave soon, regardless of others," Reeta's Baba responded, staring out the window.

Reeta sighed, "I really don't think it is a good idea for us to leave. We saw what happened to Chawhans," Reeta said quietly, running her thumb along her finger.

Reeta's Baba stops looking out at the Black smog which has surrounded their house, the dense smoke with a pungent smell still trying to find ways to get inside." I told you we'd have to leave eventually-" Reeta's Ma starts, but Reeta cut her off.

"No! we can still stay here! We still have enough food left, and four water bottles, we'll be fine for the next few days before we have to worry about leaving," Reeta's Ma screamed, pushing Reeta's hand away from her.

She looks over at both Reeta and her Baba, her blue eyes droopy, and shakes her head. "I'm leaving, you can either come with me or stay here, I don't care anymore."

Crying, Reeta grabs her arm as she moves to open the front door. "Please don't do this! We'll be fine!" Reeta whimper desperately. She ignores Reeta and opens the front door. In a flash the smoke has engulfed Reeta's Ma, Making her barely visible. Reeta screamed and tried to grab on to pull her Ma back, but something caught her leg from inside the house and pulled her back in

She watched as black smoke starts seeping from her Ma's orifices, a cloud of despair rising to the ceiling. She and her Baba stumble to the bedroom, slamming the door shut and locking them in. Then the only thing she hears is a fading news brostcast
"This is an Emergency Broadcast, Do not go outside, the air is unbreathable and the toxicity level is at a lethal level. This is an Em....."  

Reeta's Dad clenced on to her daughter, looking on the Ornamented photo hanged on the wall of Reeta's Mother.
